Block or Inline elements
------------------------

Block elements are elements that take up their own space and don't share
e.g h tags (h1, h2), p tags, ul, ol, li, div

Inline elementsare elements that can co-exist with other elements
e.g img, a, span


div --> Content Division Element
a way to group elements together in a container

span --> an inline generic element like a container used to phrase or style content
really does not do anything other than call come content out to style ...



HTML Entities
--------------
they start with & and end with a ;

This are used to display reserved characters that would normally be invalid
Also used in place of difficult to type characters
The broweser interprets them and renders the correct character instead 

search by "html entity KEYWORD"
OR https://enitycodes.com



Semantic Markup
--------------------
- new elements that work exactly like div but gives more meaning (they don't do anything div does not do)
- main, header, section, nav, footer, article, aside, summary, time, figure

==========
FORMS
==========
default method = get

NAME ATTRIBUTE
---------------
 the name attribute on the input is used to send data to the server.  <NAME>=<VALUE_INSERTED>

say the form is /tacos
and we have <input ... name="username"

value entered Ezekiel
then we have 

/tacos?username=Ezekiel


Radio
------
we need to set the value
cos whatever the value is, is what is sent to the server
else the name is sent





CSS
----
Color Palette: -> for colors
the names of the element are used in CSS


paragraph  --> p
button
h2
h1
anchor --> a


background does a lot more than background-color
background is like a grna parent tht can be used to reference several other things


CSS FONTS
==========
- https://www.cssfontstack.com/


 font-family: 'Segoe UI', Futura, Arial, sans-serif;
 the first is the highest priority, and the next is next-highest i.e if the first or previous does not exist
 more like a backup



 PSEUDO-CLASSES
 ==============
 modifiers or keywords added to the end of the selector to indicate the state of a selected element

 e.g
 - targeting check-box that has been checked
 - elements that have been hovered over

 usage: they always start with a colon ":"


 SPECIFICITY  : https://specificity.keegan.st/
 ============
 Specificity is how the browser decides which rules to apply when there's a conflict
 e.g we have conflict in the color that applies to some area

 chrome dev-tools can show you the conflict and show you which is winning as it would cross out the one losing

 Calculator: Inline styles >  ID selectors > CLASS selectors  > ELEMENT selectors

 NOTE: It's bad practise to use inline styles and "!important" as these automatically ignore specificity

                            ID selectors     class, Attribute, & Pseudo-Class Selectors      Element and Pseudo-Element Selectors
                            -----------       -----------------------------------------      ------------------------------------

 nav a.active {
    color: orange               0                           1                                           2
 }


 section p {
    color: teal                 0                           0                                           2
 }

 #submit {
    color: olive                1                           0                                           0
 }




                                            ===============
                                            THE BOX MODEL
                                            ==============
 In CSS, everything is viewed as a box


 Border Properties
 ==================
 at the least these must be provided
 ------
 BORDER-WIDTH : thickness
 BORDER-COLOR: color
 BORDER-STYLE: line style --> dashed, solid

 Setting all in one go
 ---------------------
 border: width style color



PADDING
---------
devtools:  green
 Apply to all four sides
    padding: 10px

 Vertical  | Horizontal
    padding: 5px 10px

  top | horizontal  | bottom
    padding: 1px 2px 2px

  top | right | bottom | left
    padding: 5px 1px 0 2px

   MARGIN
   -------
   devtools:  orange
   space outside the elements borders



CHANGING ELEMENT DEFAULT DISPLAY
===============================
h1s divs etc are block by default
but you can change using display to inline or inline-block

INLINE
---------
Width & Height are ignored.
margin & padding push elements away horizontally but not vertically


BLOCK
---------
Block elements break the flow of a document.
Width, Height, Margin & padding are respected.


INLINE-BLOCK
---------
Behaved like an inline elements
except Width, Height, Margin & Padding are respected



CSS UNITS
---------
Relative:

Percentages: -> they are always relative to some other value
Sometimes, its a value from the parent and at other times
from the element itself

width: 50% - half the width of the parent
line-height: 50% - half the font-size of the element itself



em
---
Width font-size,
1em equals the font-size of the parent.
2em's is twice the font-sie of the parent etc

With other properties,
1em is equal to the computed font-size of the element itself


rem
----
Relative to the **root html** element's font-size.
Often easier to work with

If the root font-size is 20px, 1rem is always 20px. 2rem is always 40px


in contrast:
ems scale based on the parent element
rems scales based on the root html's element



OPACITY AND ALPHA
===================
rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
red, green, blue  ranges from 0 - 255
alpha --> 0-1  (0 very transparent, 1 not transparent)

we ca also use hex
    #FFFF00CF  --> where the last 2 after the six is the transparency it ranges from 00-FF

- alpha only applies to the specific element it was applied on
- while opacity's transparency affects the element and all descendants


TRANSITION
============
Property name |  Duration | Timing Function | Delay

            ============================
                    FLEX BOX
            ============================
Distributing space in a container in between elements and its scales dynamically or stacks as required
so we have a flexible layout

to start, we use the property-->>
display: flex
flex-direction

                  CSS RESET
            ====================
  https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like:
default line heights,margins and font sizes of headings, and so on
