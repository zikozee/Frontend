Block or Inline elements
------------------------

Block elements are elements that take up their own space and don't share
e.g h tags (h1, h2), p tags, ul, ol, li, div

Inline elementsare elements that can co-exist with other elements
e.g img, a, span


div --> Content Division Element
a way to group elements together in a container

span --> an inline generic element like a container used to phrase or style content
really does not do anything other than call come content out to style ...



HTML Entities
--------------
they start with & and end with a ;

This are used to display reserved characters that would normally be invalid
Also used in place of difficult to type characters
The broweser interprets them and renders the correct character instead

Semantic Markup

- new elements that work exactly like div but gives more meaning (they don't do anything div does not do)
- main, header, section, nav, footer, article, aside, summary, time, figure

==========
FORMS
==========
default method = get

NAME ATTRIBUTE
---------------
 the name attribute on the input is used to send data to the server.  <NAME>=<VALUE_INSERTED>

say the form is /tacos
and we have <input ... name="username"

value entered Ezekiel
then we have 

/tacos?username=Ezekiel


Radio
------
we need to set the value
cos whatever the value is, is what is sent to the server
else the name is sent





CSS
----

the names of the element are used in CSS


paragraph  --> p
button
h2
h1
anchor --> a


background does a lot more than background-color
background is like a grna parent tht can be used to reference several other things


CSS FONTS
==========
- https://www.cssfontstack.com/


 font-family: 'Segoe UI', Futura, Arial, sans-serif;
 the first is the highest priority, and the next is next-highest i.e if the first or previous does not exist
 more like a backup



 PSEUDO-CLASSES
 ==============
 modifiers or keywords added to the end of the selector to indicate the state of a selected element

 e.g
 - targeting check-box that has been checked
 - elements that have been hovered over

 usage: they always start with a colon ":"
